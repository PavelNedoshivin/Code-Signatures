<b>Code Signatures</b><br>
This is implemenation of project "Code Signatures" which can generate and verify digital signatures made by SUAI student, Pavel Nedoshivin.<br>
Features: generating key matrixes, creating signatures for concrete message, verifying signatures (CFS and KKS schemes are used).<br>
Information about schemes:<br>
  CFS - security based on complexity of decoding attempts.<br>
  KKS - security based on compexity of used hash function.<br>
Used linear code for both schemes: binary Goppa codes.<br>
